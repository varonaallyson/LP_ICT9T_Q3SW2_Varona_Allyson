			<p>"Bibbidi-Bobbidi-BEAUTIFUL!
Legendary movie producer Walt Disney brought three of the world's greatest fairy tales to the screen. They remain among the most popular animated films of all time. The first was his groundbreaking classic "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" released in 1937. The last was the then-under appreciated "Sleeping Beauty" which made it's debut in 1959."</p>

		<div class="col-md-3"><p>The Grimm fairy tale gets a Technicolor treatment in Disney's first animated feature. Jealous of Snow White's beauty, the wicked queen orders the murder of her innocent stepdaughter, but later discovers that Snow White is still alive and hiding in a cottage with seven friendly little miners. Disguising herself as a hag, the queen brings a poisoned apple to Snow White, who falls into a death-like sleep that can be broken only by a kiss from the prince.

			<h2> 4.3 ⭐⭐⭐⭐</h2>
			<p>"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is the very first animated film featured by Disney and one of the most charming. While it's a bit different from the original fairy tale, Walt Disney took this familiar classic and turned into a family film that is still talked about over 60 years later. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is such a charming film and is another example of beautiful animation and a terrific story that could charm it's way into your heart."</p>

		<div class="col-md-3"><p>An arrogant prince is cursed to live as a terrifying beast until he finds true love. Strangely, his chance comes when he captures an unwary clockmaker, whose place is then taken by his bold and beautiful daughter Belle. Helped by the Beast's similarly enchanted servants, including a clock, a teapot and a candelabra, Belle begins to see the sensitive soul behind the fearsome facade. But as time runs out, it soon becomes obvious that Belle's cocky suitor Gaston is the real beast of the piece.</p></div>

			<h2> 4.4 ⭐⭐⭐⭐</h2>
			<p>"4.5/5 I love the original "Beauty and the Beast," it is an enchanting animated masterpiece with spectacular animation and compelling storytelling. After watching Bill Condon's live action remake, I began to realize that the original has some iffy quibbles. The compelling themes here have barely changed, however, there is one aspect to the recycled story with refreshing results."</p>

		<div class="col-md-3"><p>Fearful that her ailing father will be drafted into the Chinese military, Mulan (Ming-Na Wen) takes his spot -- though, as a girl living under a patriarchal regime, she is technically unqualified to serve. She cleverly impersonates a man and goes off to train with fellow recruits. Accompanied by her dragon, Mushu (Eddie Murphy), she uses her smarts to help ward off a Hun invasion, falling in love with a dashing captain along the way.

		<div class="col-md-3">
			<h2> 4.6 ⭐⭐⭐⭐</h2>
			<p>"A lot of viewers may identify with and look up to Mulan herself as a character. She differs from the standard Disney princess. She is a strong, independent young woman who isn't afraid to challenge social expectations and take chances in order to defend her family and nation. Mulan gains valuable knowledge about determination, bravery, and the true meaning of honor as she goes through the military training process and engages in combat with her fellow soldiers."</p>

On one of her visits to the surface, which are forbidden by her controlling father, King Triton, she falls for a human prince. Determined to be with her new love, Ariel makes a dangerous deal with the sea witch Ursula (Pat Carroll) to become human for three days. But when plans go awry for the star-crossed lovers, the king must make the ultimate sacrifice for his daughter.

			<h2> 4.0 ⭐⭐⭐⭐</h2>
			<p>"Watching "The Little Mermaid," I began to feel that the magic of animation had been restored to us. After the early years of Walt Disney's pathfinding feature-length cartoons, we entered into a long, dark age in which frame-by-frame animation was too expensive, and even the great Disney animation team began using shortcuts. Now computers have taken the busywork out of the high-priced hands of humans, who are free to realize even the most elaborate flights of imagination. And that's certainly what they do in this film."</p>
